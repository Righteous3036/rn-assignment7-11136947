## Design Choices
For a smooth and intuitive user experience, we made the following design choices:
- **Navigation**: We used `@react-navigation` to easily move between different screens.
- **Data Fetching**: We chose `axios` to fetch data from an external API because it's simple and powerful.
- **Local Storage**: To keep cart items even when the app is closed, we utilized `AsyncStorage`.

## Implementation
Here's how we implemented the key features:
- **HomeScreen**: This screen fetches and displays a list of products from the API.
- **ProductDetailScreen**: On this screen, users can see detailed information about a product and add it to their cart.
- **CartScreen**: This screen shows the items in the user's cart and allows them to remove items if needed.

## Screenshots
Take a look at some screenshots of the app in action:
